Welcome to Qsolver!
This program allows you to enter the coefficients of a quadratic
function, and finds the real roots of that function if any exist.
Please enter input as space seperated numerical values.
please enter a, b, c : 
"1 -3 2"
quit not detected in 1 -3 2
Solving: 1.0x^2 + -3.0x + 2.0 = 0
x1 : 1.0, x2 : 2.0
please enter a, b, c : 
"1 2 3"
quit not detected in 1 2 3
Solving: 1.0x^2 + 2.0x + 3.0 = 0
no real roots
please enter a, b, c : 
"quit"
quit detected in quit
