directory structure :
  src/
    qsolver/ ( main )
    validate/
    read_line/
    print_line/
    solve/
    result/ ( messages for validate/solve result codes )
  system_testing/



have to check the digits of precision when it is in string form
  put that off until release 2

also put checking stability off until release 2


readline and other functions should return an int flag for result type
  ie : 0 for good, 1+ for errors


all functions must validate input/params
  ie : check line is not null, coefficients are not NaN or Infinity


all functions must have documentation covering
  what the function does
  param info ( what it accepts )
  return info ( what it returns )


logging to file


no IO in utility functions
  ie : print ( console logging )


he wants the unit tests in the module directories ( maybe? )
  and system testing in a sibling directory to src
