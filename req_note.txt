he said there should be a warning if there was
more than 4 digits of precision on the input
  ex : 3.000156 for a, b, or c


this can be done in a future release



he also wants us to check the values of a, b, c
in *both* the validate_input and solve functions
  in case the solve function gets used
  by another project that does not use
  the validate_input function before it

  maybe we could have a collection of predicate functions
  that are imported by both validate_input and solve
  to avoid repeated code
