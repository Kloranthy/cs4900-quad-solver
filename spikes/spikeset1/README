This directory contains 2 spikes, implemented in the following files

quadsolver.py:
    this does not solve the equation but rather explores ways of validating user input and looking for exit condition(s)
    run with
        make run

bufferror.py:
    this is a clone of quadsolver.py that puts a 3 second sleep after each user userinput to give opportunity to put user input into buffer.
    Having UI in input buffer gives opportunity to experiment with buffer flushing. HOWEVER, python on linux does not allow for much
    interaction with the buffer. It seems there are packages such as 'curses' which use C functions to handle ui and would therefore allow
    for input buffer flushing.
    run with:  
        make bufferror
